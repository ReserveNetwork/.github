# Reserve Network

Reserve Network (R-Net) is a wireless digital communication network specifically designed for emergency situations in which existing communication infrastructure becomes inoperable for any reason.
It can continue to function under adverse conditions, such as low bandwidth and high latency, and it is self-configuring. R-Net is a complete cryptography-based network stack that can be used to create both local and global networks with easily accessible, widely available communication hardware. The ultimate goal of R-Net is to enable anyone to become their own network operator, making it inexpensive and easy to cover large areas with a multitude of independent, interconnected, and autonomous networks.
